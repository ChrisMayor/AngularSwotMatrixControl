# Account SWOT Matix for Dynamics 365: 
Angular 7 / Webpack 4 / To Dynamics Webresource

## Highlights:

* 2 ways to build the application (Angular or Webpack) -- ng build prefered
* Angular 7.x
* Angular Material
* Angular CDK
* Drag and Drop
* Webpack 4.x
* Integration with D365 Form oder D365 Web Api

Idea to include in Dynamics Webresource (with the deployment tool) to get a custom Webresource with Angular 7 / Angular Material
Prove that the Production Build really gets super small, even with Angular and Angular Material
This project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.2.0.

## Minimum requirements:

* D365 8.2 / 9.x on premise for the Form-Integration
* D365 9.0 for Web Api Integration

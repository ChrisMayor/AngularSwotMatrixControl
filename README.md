## Description

Idea to include an custom Angular 7 Control in Dynamics 365 as Webresource.

Proves that the production build gets really super small (currently ~500kb), even with Angular and Angular Material
This project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.2.0.

## Minimum requirements:

* Dynamics 365 8.2 / 9.x on premise or online for form integration (solution / manual currently not available)
* D365 9.x for Web Api Integration

## Some todos

This is just a small project I did after my normal full time job, so there are still some open points:

* Unit testing
* Configuration of the matrix with a separate configuration entity
* CI integration
* Some UI enhancements
* Write manual for the 8.x form integration
* Icons are currently integrated via Googles CDN - maybe needs to be replaced if this is not suiteable for your implementation
